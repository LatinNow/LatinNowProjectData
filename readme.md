# LatinNow Project data

## Description

This repo consists of the database of inscribed epigraphic objects created by the ERC-funded [LatinNow project][1] (2017-2023) and used as the source material for the [open access volumes][2] published by the LatinNow team.


## Getting Started

Please note that at present, this repo consists only of the database table exports. The DDL of the database schema, a data dictionary, and further information about how to independently recreate the database will be added to this respository in the near future.
