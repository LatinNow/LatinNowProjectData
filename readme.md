# LatinNow Project data

## Description

This repo consists of the database of inscribed epigraphic objects created by the ERC-funded [LatinNow project][1] (2017-2023) and used as the source material for the [open access volumes][2] published by the LatinNow team.


## Getting Started

Each table in the LatinNow database has been exported as a tab-delimited file encoded in the UTF-8 character set. One table, lawtnow_source, has been compressed into a ZIP file to circumvent GitHub's 100 MB file size limit.

## Documentation
An SQL DDL file in MySQL format (LatinNowDB.sql) has been provided to allow recreation of the database. An entity relationship diagram (LatinNowDB Schema.pdf) representing the database schema has also been provided to facilitate an understanding of the database structure. Please report any errors to [Scott Vanderbilt](https://github.com/sarcanon).

## Authors

Alex Mullen, Scott Vanderbilt, Anna Willi, Pieter Houten, Simona Stoyanova (all University of Nottingham at the time of the data creation).
