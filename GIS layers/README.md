# LatinNow GIS layers

## Terms of use

The inscribed object (`epigraphy_inscr_object`) and writing equipment (`writing_equipment`) layers in the LatinNow webGIS have been created by the LatinNow project and have been made available under a Creative Commons Attribute License (CC-BY-4.0) https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.en.

The other layers were not created by the LatinNow project, though permission was granted for us to publish them along with our own datasets. This permission does not extend to other projects, so the data provided here is solely for personal use. If you wish to use it in any other way, new permission must be sought. Please refer to the layer information within the [https://gis.latinnow.eu/](LatinNow webGIS) (click on the (i) icons next to the layers in the left-hand column) to find the rights holders. Permission to use all LatinNow additions and modifications (where applicable) is hereby granted under the CC-BY-4.0 terms noted above.

## Use of the GeoJSON files

You can download the files from this folder and load them into any modern GIS system that should support GeoJSON. The layer structure should be straightforward for the most part. In the main LatinNow layer (`epigraphy_inscr_object`) the category names have been abbreviated to keep the file size down. The meaning of the categories is as follows:

 * la: Language
 * sc: Script
 * bi: Bilingual text type
 * ma: Material
 * ob: Object type
 * te: Text type
 * st: Date range start
 * en: Date range end
 * pn: Place name
 * pr: Province
